# Ethical Dilemmas With Landslide Susceptibility

## Basic Ethical Procedures

As with any tool these maps and processes can be used in both good and bad ways. Therefore it is important to understand the ethical issues that may arise from our projects. Hopefully to either aviod or minimalize these issues. Unfortunately, sometimes there are things out of your control that affect people not because you were malitious, but do to others using your research in new ways you could never have dreamed of.

As with all things intent, explination, and permission are key factors in any project. Your intent should be to benifit your area instead of negatively impact them in any way shape or form. To make that intent a reality there are percautions that one should take. These include informing people in the study area what you are intending to do and getting feedback from them. Informing them of EVERYTHING you intend to do to gather information and how that information will be used. 

## Geoethics 

Geoethics deals with the ethical, social, and cultural issues that arise out of any sort of study of the Earth's systems. These could vary from polotics, philosophy, geology, or GIS as these all change how we view or use the Earth's resources either physically or socially. Since our job is to produce a map that is designed to change how people view the area around them, with the aim to specifically warn them about potential landslide hazards, our process falls under geoethics.
