### Creating A Toolbox For Critical Rainfall Threshold Method
  This week we went over the python method for creating toolboxes in arcpro, which is a time-consuming, but rewarding 
  endevor. During this we also looked into other ways to make tools. Specifically, Unstable Ground Consulting made several
  different tools that would work for the Critial Rainfall Threshold Method in [ModelBuilder](https://unstable-ground-consulting.github.io/Landslide-Susceptibility/How-To/).
  
  What is interesting is that the model builder makes a little more sense after the python instruction as it seems to be a slightly more simplistic version of that process. The logic between the two is very similar, the model builder is probably easier to someone new to programming.
