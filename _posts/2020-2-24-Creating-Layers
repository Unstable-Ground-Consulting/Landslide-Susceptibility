A lot of work was done in the research and data preperation this week. A major goal of this week was to find usable data for Albania, focusing on DEMs, boundaries, roads, and buildings.

The DEMs aquired were through the EU's [Copernicus Land Monitering Service](https://land.copernicus.eu/). The DEMs were aquired through a tiling system so we had to figure out a way to stich the two DEMs together.

ENTER MOSAIC TOOLS
  The tool used to put the rasters together was the 'mosaic to new raster tool'
