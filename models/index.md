## Models Used For Landslide Susceptibility

*Critical Rainfall Threshold Model* (Eq. 28, Iverson, 2000)
```
     tan φ       C - ψt * γw * (tan φ)
Fs = -----  +  --------------------------
     tan θ     γr * H * (sin θ) * (cos θ)
```

Fs= Factor of Safety

φ = Internal Angle of Friction

θ = Hillslope

C = Soil Cohesion

ψt = Pressure Head

γw = Unit Weight of Water

γr = Unit Weight of Soil Regolith

H = Depth of Soil Regolith


This model is designed to predict the infiltration of rainfall into the landscape. 

[*FR*](file:///C:/Users/Jacob%20Werner/Downloads/water-11-01402-v2.pdf)

FR is the Frequency Ratio bivariate model that focuses on the possibility of occurance for a given characteristic.
