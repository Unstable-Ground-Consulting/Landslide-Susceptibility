## Models Used For Landslide Susceptibility

*Critical Rainfall Threshold Model* (Eq. 28, Iverson, 2000)
```
     tan φ       C - ψt * γw * (tan φ)
Fs = -----  +  --------------------------
     tan θ     γr * H * (sin θ) * (cos θ)
```
This model is designed to predict the infiltration of rainfall into the landscape.
