## Models Used For Landslide Susceptibility

*Critical Rainfall Threshold Model* (Eq. 28, Iverson, 2000)
```
     tan φ       C - ψt * γw * (tan φ)
Fs = -----  +  --------------------------
     tan θ     γr * H * (sin θ) * (cos θ)
```
φ = 

θ = Hillslope

C = 

ψt = 

γw = 

γr = 

H =


This model is designed to predict the infiltration of rainfall into the landscape. 

[*Fequency Ratio*](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/11/7/1402/pdf)
