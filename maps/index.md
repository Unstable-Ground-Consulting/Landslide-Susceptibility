# Landslide Susceptibility Maps

The Landslide Susceptibility maps are all calcualted using the Critical Rainfall Model that was covered in [another section of this website](). Each site relies on dffferent levels of data though. Tirana has less direct data for its map than Willits as some of the data had to be researched and georefrenced. Therefore its results is a little blockier and more general and Willits' data. Due to the extent the Soil Map Survey of the United States over the lack of data of Albania.

## Tirana, Albania

All of the maps done for Tirana, Albania are done in the ETRS  1989 ALBANIA 2010 projection, as recommended from the [Albanian Government's GIS portal](https://geoportal.asig.gov.al/en/help/arcgis).

NOTE: Due to the issues finding an updated soil map of Albania, the soil data was gained from a 2003 soil map as described in the most recent [blog](https://unstable-ground-consulting.github.io/Landslide-Susceptibility/blog/2020/03/13/down-to-the-wire). Therefore, the data and resolution are not equvilent to the Willits data, and needs more research to become better defined.

# Impact On Structures

## Tirana, Albania

For structures we were only able to find correct data on road systems in Tirana so that is what we looked at. The roads were defined into seven catagories, National road, Railroad, Domestic Roads, Village Roads, Gravel roads, Seasonal roads, and Unclassified roads. The seasonal and unclassified roads only included one or two roads in the range we were looking at so they have been removed from the impact maps.

Due to the density of the roads we have produced a combined map as well as several maps looking at the specific catagory of roads.

## Willits, California

Similar to Tirana, the structures I will be covering in Willits are the road systems, mostly due to time issues rather than lack of data.
