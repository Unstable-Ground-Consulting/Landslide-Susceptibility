[Analysis of landslide inventories for accurate prediction of debris-flow source areas](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.wm.edu/science/article/pii/S0169555X10000863)

  This article focuses on swapping out landslide inventories for certain models to determine the importance of landslide inventories in the modeling process. GIS is a large part of it as that is how the models and variable were created and combined. This paper highlights the benefits and pitfalls of landslide data, being very useful if accurate or present. They explicitly discuss how often the temporal data is problematic. Temporal data would allow for time cube analysis that could identify useful trends within the data, which could help increase the accuracy of these landslide inventory models. Making them invaluable in landslide susceptibility.

  According to the data and limitations that are represented here, landslide inventory models like the Weight of Evidence models would not be useful for the Albanian data as there is no landslide inventory for Albania. Although I would love to try this with the Willis data, there is a lot of process that would take longer than the time frame currently allows for. This paper does give some ideas on what factors could be added or integrated into other models to perhaps give a clearer picture of landslides. 

  The use of landslide inventories is very useful in places that have good records, as seen in this paper Italy is one of those places. This could also be used effectively in the United States town for his project, Willis California. Unfortunately, the rest of the United States is a toss-up as their reporting varies by state. For example, look at New Mexico compared to all other states.
