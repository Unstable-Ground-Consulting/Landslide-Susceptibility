[Analysis of landslide inventories for accurate prediction of debris-flow source areas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X10000863)

```
This paper by Jan Blahut, Cees van Westen, and Simone Sterlacchini, focuses on multiple ways to utilize landslide inventories to better compare the methodology of landslide suceptibility models. 
  If this project were to continue past the current timeframe this process would be useful in determining which models would be more effective for the area.
