## Unstable Ground, Modeling Landslide Suseptibility

A consulting group created for an Advanced GIS class, designed around making models to measure landslide suseptibility in the United States and Albania. This site also designed to gather and display resources about landslides.

### Our Purpose

<p>Our group focuses on the ever-changing nature of Earth's surface and how we can evaluate and predict landslides to help communities. We create landslide susceptibility models to inform communities about hazards, research impacts of landslides on communities, and unify our knowledge to better integrate civil projects and the envrionment. <a href="https://unstable-ground-consulting.github.io/Landslide-Susceptibility/blog/t">Read more about our company and mission...</a></p>
