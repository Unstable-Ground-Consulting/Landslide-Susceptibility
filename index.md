## Unstable Ground, Modeling Landslide Suseptibility

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Unstable-Ground-Consulting/Landslide-Susceptibility/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Our Purpose

<p>Our group focuses on the ever-changing nature of Earth's surface and how we can evaluate and predict landslides to help communities. We create landslide susceptibility models to inform communities about hazards, research impacts of landslides on communities, and unify our knowledge to better integrate civil projects and the envrionment. <a href="/about">Read more about our company and mission...</a></p>
